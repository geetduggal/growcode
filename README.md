missing models: a data driven approach for learning how networks grow. To
Appear: Proc. 18th Intl. Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

+ Equal contributions

Requirements
------------

For the runnable jar (growcode.jar):
* Java 1.6 or greater

For building and editing source:
* Scala 2.9.1 or greater. (http://scala-lang.org)
* Simple Build Tool (SBT) 

Running
-------

The 'runexample.sh' script shows how to run a basic learning and program
selection procedure using the SBT framework.  The learning procedure is
associated with a variety of genetic algorithm parameters that can be
customized in each example's '.params' file.  Please see the EJC documentation
(ECJ link) for more information on what these parameters mean.

To Do
-----

* Comment source code more formally
* Make the network properties tested in BestProgramProblem.scala selectable via
  a config file or command line interface
